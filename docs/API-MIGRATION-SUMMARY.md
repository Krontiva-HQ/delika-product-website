# API Migration Summary

## Changes Made

We've successfully implemented a solution to prevent API URLs from being exposed in the browser console. Here's a summary of the changes:

### 1. Created TypeScript API Utility File

- Converted `lib/api.js` to `lib/api.ts` with proper TypeScript types
- Added interfaces for common response types:
  - `AuthResponse` - For authentication responses with auth tokens
  - `OTPResponse` - For OTP verification responses
  - `UserData` - For user data structure

### 2. Updated Login and Signup Components

- Modified `components/login-modal.tsx` to use our API utility functions:
  - Replaced direct API calls with `login()` and `authRequest()` functions
  - Added proper type annotations for API responses
  - Removed duplicate interface definitions

- Modified `components/signup-modal.tsx` to use our API utility functions:
  - Replaced direct API calls with `authRequest()` function
  - Added proper type annotations for API responses
  - Removed duplicate interface definitions

### 3. Updated Store Header Component

- Modified `components/store-header.tsx` to use our API utility functions:
  - Replaced direct API calls with `getBranches()`, `getCustomerDetails()`, and `updateFavorites()` functions
  - Updated `fetchUserFavorites` function to use `getCustomerDetails()` instead of direct fetch
  - Updated `handleLikeToggle` function to use `updateFavorites()` instead of direct fetch
  - Improved error handling and user experience

### 4. Created API Routes

- Implemented API routes in Next.js to proxy requests to the external API:
  - `app/api/auth/route.js` - For login requests
  - `app/api/auth/[...path]/route.js` - For all other auth-related requests
  - `app/api/branches/route.js` - For fetching branch data
  - `app/api/customer/details/route.js` - For fetching customer details
  - `app/api/favorites/route.js` - For updating user favorites (using PATCH method)

### 5. Improved Environment Variable Configuration

- Updated environment variables to support both client-side and server-side usage:
  - Added server-side variables without the `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix
  - Maintained client-side variables with the `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix
  - Ensured API routes can access environment variables correctly

### 6. Enhanced API Route Error Handling

- Added comprehensive error handling to API routes:
  - Improved error messages with specific status codes
  - Added logging for better debugging
  - Implemented checks for missing environment variables
  - Added cache control to prevent caching issues

## Benefits

1. **Security**: API URLs are no longer exposed in the browser console
2. **Type Safety**: Added TypeScript types for better developer experience and fewer runtime errors
3. **Maintainability**: Centralized API calls in utility functions for easier updates
4. **Flexibility**: Added ability to add middleware, logging, or other functionality to API routes
5. **Consistency**: Standardized API interaction patterns across the application
6. **Reliability**: Improved error handling and debugging capabilities

## How It Works

1. Client-side code calls our API utility functions (e.g., `login()`, `authRequest()`, `updateFavorites()`)
2. These functions make requests to our Next.js API routes (e.g., `/api/auth`, `/api/favorites`)
3. The API routes make the actual requests to the external API
4. The response is returned to the client without exposing the external API URL

## Environment Variable Configuration

We've set up the environment variables to work in both client-side and server-side contexts:

1. **Server-side variables** (without `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix):
   - Used in API routes and server components
   - Not exposed to the client
   - Example: `BRANCHES_API`, `CUSTOMER_DETAILS_API`, `FAVORITES_API`

2. **Client-side variables** (with `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix):
   - Used in client components
   - Accessible in the browser
   - Example: `NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY`

## Next Steps

1. Continue migrating any remaining direct API calls to use our API utility functions
2. Add error handling and loading states to improve user experience
3. Consider adding caching or other optimizations to the API routes
4. Implement comprehensive error handling in API routes
5. Add request validation to ensure data integrity
